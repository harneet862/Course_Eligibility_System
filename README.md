# Course_Eligibility_System

This project automates the process of determining which university courses a student is eligible to take, based on prerequisite relationships between courses.

It parses course prerequisite data, builds a dependency graph, and uses topological sorting to compute valid course orderings. The system can handle messy prerequisite text (like “one of A or B” and “A and B”) and even supports automated scraping of course data using Beautiful Soup.

🚀 Features

Automated Parsing: Extracts course prerequisite relationships from a text file or website.

Dependency Graph Construction: Builds a directed graph representing course dependencies.

Topological Sorting: Computes valid course sequences and detects cycles.

Eligibility Checking: Determines which courses a student can take based on their completed courses.

Web Scraping Template: Includes a BeautifulSoup-based scraper for automatically gathering course data.
